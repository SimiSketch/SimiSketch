## Build
To build the executable,you need to install clang (at least version 10) first.
Type make in the shell, the project will be automatically built and the executable will be located at exec/exp.
## Run
We choose a little dataset dataset/zipf_0.5.dat for you to test our algorithm, which can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhR-FW8CB17uirKSbQUnhlbT2qc2Ugye/view?usp=share_link. Before running the program, make sure to download the dataset, and place it in the directory ```dataset''' as ```dataset/zipf_0.5.dat```. Type make test in the shell, the generated executable exec/exp will be executed.(The src/main.cpp will be executed)
## Src/include
The all algorithms we used are realized in this folder.
And some files which named with test are the test function for their relevant algorithms.
